## Troubleshooting

#### Command not found

If you successfully installed ubiops-cli but `ubiops --version` gives the following error: `ubiops: command not found`, you are likely missing the directory in you PATH variable where PIP installs scripts. You could solve this by adding the directory to your PATH variable. Please, visit https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-to-the-user-site for more information.

- Linux and macOS: `~/.local/bin`
- Windows: something like `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python36\Scripts`
